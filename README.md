# Overview

Simple plugin to send block items to Things3.

Note: Retrieving items from Things3 is much more complex than sending. Hence, please do not put up feature requests for retrieval.

# Usage

Right click on any block and click on "Send to Things3".

# Installation

There are currently no plans to put this plugin on the Logseq marketplace at present. Hence, please download a [release](https://github.com/hkgnp/sendtothings3/releases) and install it manually in Logseq.
